Since the KE69X0 uses standard IP protocols to transfer media and data, in theory there are no distance limitations, however, there are limitations inherent with network devices(hubs, switches, routers, etc.),
bandwidth considerations,and network device settings (IGMP).

We have tested the following switches: CISCO Catalyst 2960X, CISCO Catalyst 2960XR, CISCO Catalyst 3750, HP Procurve 2920, H3C    S5120, Huawei S5700.

KE69x0 can reach up to 100m in extender mode (This is a direct point-to-point connection).

Matrix Mgr Lite R2 selects TX/RX randomly.  (first come, first serve)  Users can  remove and add-in TX/RX to decide which 8 * TX/RX are selected.

The maximum limitation bandwidth is 500Mbps. It may be set by using the RS-232 command found on page 182 of the KE6900's user manual.The options are Unlimited, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500.

Yes, KE6900 and KE6940 both use lossless compression in video transmission.

The 'Graphics' button and the 'Video' button use different image compressions depending on the needs, the 'Graphics' button is used for transmitting text or still image, but the 'Video' button is used to transmit moving picture, for example, watching a video clip from a computer.

There are three different methods to access the KE6900ST: First, Via a network; use a browser to log in to KE6900ST or use a utility supporting Telnet , and any utility supporting Telnet or Microsoft Command Prompt will work; Second , KE6900ST comes equipped with a serial connection , so any serial communications utilitycan be used to access the unit the protocols and commands are provided in the unit's manual; Third , the unit also provides an OSD, so users can connect to the unit with a keyboard , mouse and monitorfor local access.

The maximum resolution is 1920x1200 @ 60 Hz.

Using a point-to-point connection (straight connection no network hubs or switches between) , the KE6900ST can be extended up to 100M. With a Gigabit network switch or hub, the extension is only limited by the network devices to which the KE6900ST is attached Note: A multiple tier application maybe required, depending on the ability of the network components.

No, KE6900ST works the same way as KE6900 allowing one transmitter to connect to one or more receivers.

Yes, for data transmission, KE6900ST is encrypted with AES and TLS.

For best results, we recommend a Giga LAN network switch or a router with IGMP functionality. For detailed requirement, please see the criteria below. Dedicated Non-Blocking switch is preferred in order to prevent congestion from one switch to another when interconnection is needed or applied. Gigabit (1000 Mbps) or faster Ethernet ports is recommended Support IGMP v2 or v3 snooping (Multicast) Supports IGMP Querier Multicast routing switch is needed for different IP segments High bandwidth connections between switches, preferably by fiber channel Check the throughput of the switch and ensure the up and downstream data speed of each port is 1 Gigabit per second Using switches from the same manufacturers throughout the entire installation to meet the best compatibility and to prevent the incompatibility, if possible.

Yes, ATEN carries a PS/2 to USB converter called UC10KM for this type of application . For details, please check out the website http://www.aten.com/global/en/products/kvm/kvm-modules-&-accessories/uc10km/#.WP1oR0V96Uk .

The KE6900 has no provisions to disable the login requirements.

Yes, the KE69xx will work with the KE89xx Transmitter and Receiver.

Please make sure  the KE6900T and KE6900R use the same firmware version.

The KE dedicated LAN port is able to convert UTP to fiber via RJ45 to fiber box (Gigabit Media Converter) .

KE6900ST can support maximum 6 USB devices.

Yes, KE accepts the commands via Serial, Telent or TCP/IP with user/password protection.

The different between KE8950 and KE8952 is PoE, the KE8952 supports Power over Ethernet (PoE) in compliance with the IEEE 802.3at and IEEE 802.3af standards.

Please have a look the switch which is on the rear of transmitter. The purpose of the function switch is to set the permission of the unit (transmitter and receiver). If the switch is located on Local, the control from receiver will be locked. In this situation, please set the switch to Auto mode for making sure both transmitter and receiver can make control. Otherwise, there are icons next to the USB port for recognising keyboard and mouse. The keyboard and mouse should be installed in the related port, please refer to user manual page 9.

KE8950/KE8952 are verified and can work properly with ATEN 2A-136G/2A-137G. They are sold as a device and being fully verified. We did not test on another SFP and we did not know if another SFP can properly work with KE8950/KE8952.

Please try default account 'administrator', password 'password' and check again.

Most gaming keyboard/mouse requires power much more than regular keyboard/mouse, we suggest adding a powered USB Hub between the KE6900R/KE6940R and the Keyboard. And Bluetooth keyboard/mouse cannot work on KE6900 since they do not have receiver dongle to connect to KE6900. We suggest using keyboard/mouse from Microsoft or Logitech for better compatibility.

Please select Manual EDID on CCKM and the issue can able to fix: when selecting Manual EDID, KE6900 adopts real EDID from connected monitor and can eliminate EDID related issue.

KE6900 supports RS232 and Telnet control: For RS232 control, please connect your RS232 cable to any KE6900R; for Telnet, you can just login any KE6900R for the control; Please note KE6900 should be in Matrix mode for external control; For for more detail, please refer to attachment and user manual from page 17.

No , to reset password to default, please refer to below: First , Un-screw and open the case, Second , find the jumper pin, there a line 'Default Password' printed on the board ; Third , attach the jumper on it, power the unit on then wait for 1 minute; Fourth , power-off the unit and remove the jumper, The password should be reset to 'password' now.

To operate Matrix feature, you will need to have Matrix Manager installed, otherwise the system will keep looking for KE management software, Telnet or RS232 command is only available when KE is in Matrix mode.

KE is an over-IP extender and it follows TCP/IP limitation on cable length of 100m peer to peer in extender mode. When connecting to a network switch, then up to 200m(100m each end) can be extended.

We have tested KE and it supports USB Mass Storage, USB Smart Card Reader, USB Printer, USB Scanner, USB Game Controller, USB KB, USB MS, USB Touch Screen, USB Pen Tablet/Sign Pad, Apple iPOD. KE may not support some of USB asynchronous mode devices: such as USB Fingerprint Readerï¼ŒUSB Speaker. In case of incompatible USB device encountered, we need to fix the problem case by case.

KE6900ST is designed to be managed by CCKM (KE Management Software). NOTE:The CCKM version must be v1.4.138 or above. For license, we provide free license for KE nodes less than (included) 8; If your KE are more than 8 then you need to purchase license for matrix mode management.

The Blu-Ray player "Full HD" video requires HDCP to work, but KE6900 does not support HDCP. For HDCP content, we suggest KE89xx as it supports HDCP. And we do not recommend HDCP Bypass device as it may render legal issue.

The KE8950 and KE8952 both support single mode and multi mode fiber. We strongly suggest you purchase 2A-136G and 2A-137G for KE89xx SFP utilization.

The CCKM service may be blocked by an OS firewall or antivirus software, please try to temporarily disable them first and please use administrator privilege to reinstall CCKM then observe. CCKM default web address is https://localhost:8443 and if it occupied, please modify the port number during CCKM installation. 'Windows error 2' message is most likely caused by an incorrect Java path.

We have tested and confirmed that CCKM can be installed on Windows server version 2012, 2012R2, and 2016. For CCKM install on Linux, please refer to attachment.

The difference between picture mode and video mode is the bandwidth and quality of the video: Picture mode uses considerably less bandwidth compared to Video mode because picture mode is transmitted frame by frame, while video mode is transmitted by picture group. Please refer to attachment for our suggestion on bandwidth and switches.

Please refer to attachment for RS232 communication wiring and loopback test scenario.
